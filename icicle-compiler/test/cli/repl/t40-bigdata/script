-- Some simple good ones
from salary ~> windowed 1 months ~> fold x = 0 then 1 ~> x

from salary ~> windowed 1 months ~> sum value

from salary ~> windowed between 1 months and 2 months ~> sum value

from salary ~> latest 10 ~> sum value


-- Some obviously bad ones
from salary ~> fold x = 0 then 1 ~> x

from salary ~> sum value

from salary ~> sum value + count value

-- Part good, part bad
from salary ~> sum value + (latest 10 ~> count value)


-- More good ones
from salary ~> latest 10 ~> sum value * count value

from salary ~> (latest 10 ~> sum value) * (latest 10 ~> count value)


-- Some good let bindings
from salary ~> latest 10 ~> let x = value ~> sum x

from salary ~> let x = value ~> latest 10 ~> sum x

-- Some bad let bindings
from salary ~> let x = sum value ~> x

from salary ~> let x = value ~> sum x
