-- Nested groups
from cylon ~> group (year_of time) ~> group (day_of time) ~> count value

-- Distinct inside groups is also a common use case.
from cylon ~> group (year_of time) ~> distinct (day_of time) ~> count value

-- Nested distincts don't really make sense, but technically possible.
from cylon ~> distinct (year_of time) ~> distinct (day_of time) ~> count value
from cylon ~> distinct (year_of time) ~> group (day_of time) ~> count value
