-- Simplest group-by there is
from salary ~> group value ~> count value

-- Grouping by the time
from salary ~> group time ~> count value

-- Filter before group
from salary ~> filter value > 100 ~> group time ~> count value

-- Filter after group.
-- Note that this gives us counts of zero
from salary ~> group time ~> filter value > 100 ~> count value

-- Group with average
from salary ~> group time ~> mean value

-- Throw some constants in for good measure
from salary ~> group time ~> sum (value + 3) * 5
