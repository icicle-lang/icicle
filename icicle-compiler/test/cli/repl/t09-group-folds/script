-- Count unique times, this is equivalent to `distinct time ~> count`
from salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> count v

-- Sum of count of values, this is equivalent to counting the number of salary facts
from salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> sum v

-- Max of count of values
from salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> max v

-- Fold over oldests. Not really that meaningful but a useful test
from salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> oldest value) ~> max v

-- Tuple binding values in group folds
from injury ~> group fold (_, (severity, counts)) = (group location ~> (mean severity, count severity)) ~> min_by counts severity
