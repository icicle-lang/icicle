-- Count unique times, this is equivalent to `distinct time ~> count`
feature salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> count v

-- Sum of count of values, this is equivalent to counting the number of salary facts
feature salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> sum v

-- Max of count of values
feature salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> count value) ~> max v

-- Fold over oldests. Not really that meaningful but a useful test
feature salary ~> group fold (k, v) = (group time ~> oldest value) ~> max v

-- Tuple binding values in group folds
feature injury ~> group fold (_, (severity, counts)) = (group location ~> (mean severity, count severity)) ~> min_by counts severity
