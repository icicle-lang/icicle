-- Simple trigonometry functions
-- We need to test with boring numbers, because interesting numbers might print slightly differently
from salary ~> acos 1
from salary ~> asin 0
from salary ~> atan 0
from salary ~> atan2 0 0
from salary ~> cos 0
from salary ~> cosh 0
from salary ~> sin 0
from salary ~> sinh 0
from salary ~> tan 0
from salary ~> tanh 0

-- This makes sure Possiblies are being unwrapped and rewrapped correctly
from salary ~> atan2 (sin 1) (cos 1)
from salary ~> atan2 (sin (1/0)) (cos 1)
