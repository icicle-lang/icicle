-- Elem/Scalar lets
from salary ~> let x = value * 2 ~> sum x

-- Pure let, can use it everywhere
from salary ~> let sx = 13013 ~> sum (value + sx) - (sx * count value)

-- Aggregate let
from salary ~> let sx = sum value ~> sx * 2

-- Aggregate let outside filter
from salary ~> let sx = sum value ~> filter value > 100 ~> (sx, sum value)

-- Scalar let before group
from salary ~> let x = value ~> group x ~> sum x

-- Agg let before group
from salary ~> let x = sum value ~> group value ~> x

-- Agg let before and after group
from salary ~> let x = sum value ~> group value ~> let y = sum value ~> (x, y)
