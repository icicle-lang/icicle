-- Divisions return Possibles.
-- Try with group:
from salary ~> group (trunc (double value / 200)) ~> sum (double value / 5) / 5

-- Distincts
from salary ~> distinct (double value / 5) ~> sum (double value / 5) / 5

-- Maybe some lets
from salary ~> let x = 2 / 1 ~> sum (trunc (double value * x))

-- Add a filter
from salary ~> let x = 2 / 1 ~> filter (double value > x) ~> count value

-- newest or something
from salary ~> (newest (double value) / 5, oldest (double value / 5), sum value)

-- This was causing an issue with nested possibility cases before
from salary ~> latest 1 ~> case (0,sum value) of (z,s) then s

-- Constructing a Right of a Possibility was causing an issue before
from salary ~> fold x = 0 then value ~> Right x

-- Primitive returning possibly (map_insert), applied to a definite primitive (,)
from salary ~> (map_insert 0 0 map_create, 0)

-- Same deal, more or less
from salary ~> fold x = (map_insert 0 0 map_create, 0) then (map_insert value value (fst x), snd x + 1) ~> x
